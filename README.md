# HederaVault
*A non-custodial DeFi wallet unlocking seamless Hedera-powered finance*  

---

## Overview  
**HederaVault** is a decentralized wallet built for the **Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025**.  
It solves the problem of **expensive cross-border payments** and **limited access to DeFi tools** by leveraging **Hedera Hashgraph**’s fast, low-cost, and eco-friendly infrastructure.  

---

## Problem  
- High fees for sending money across borders  
- Poor user experience in existing crypto wallets  
- Custodial wallets force users to give up control of their assets  
- Lack of accessible DeFi solutions tailored for African users  

---

## Our Solution  
HederaVault makes DeFi simple and accessible by:  
- **Multi-token support** → send, receive, and swap Hedera Token Service (HTS) assets  
- **Cross-border remittance** → stablecoin integration to reduce costs  
- **Portfolio & yield tracking** → staking and passive income dashboards  
- **User-friendly onboarding** → optional Web2 login and recovery for new users  

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express  
- **Blockchain:** Hedera Hashgraph (HTS + HCS)  
- **Wallet SDKs:** HashConnect, Hedera JS SDK  
- **Database (optional):** Firebase (for non-sensitive user settings)
