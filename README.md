# HederaVault
DeFi wallet BUIDL for Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025

---

## Overview  
HederaVault is a decentralized wallet built for the **Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025**.  
It solves the problem of expensive, clunky, and insecure access to digital finance across Africa by leveraging **Hedera Hashgraph**â€™s fast, low-cost, and eco-friendly infrastructure.  

---

## Problem  
- High fees for cross-border payments  
- Poor UX in existing crypto wallets  
- Lack of trust + control (custodial wallets dominate)  
- Limited access to stable DeFi tools for everyday users  

---

## Our Solution  
HederaVault makes DeFi accessible by:  
- **Multi-token support** â†’ send, receive, and swap Hedera Token Service (HTS) assets.  
- **Cross-border remittance** â†’ stablecoin integration to cut down fees.  
- **Portfolio & yield tracking** â†’ staking and passive income dashboards.  
- **User-friendly onboarding** â†’ optional Web2 login + recovery features.

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express  
- **Blockchain:** Hedera Hashgraph (HTS + HCS)  
- **Wallet SDKs:** HashConnect, Hedera JS SDK

## Architecture (Conceptual)
